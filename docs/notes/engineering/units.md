[SI units](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html) must be used
by default. If unit other than SI is used, the variable name must
indicate it.

`mass = 10` - means 10 kg

`mass_lbs = 25` - unit other than SI

## Base SI Units

$$s$$ - second, measures time

$$m$$ - meter, measures length

$$kg$$ - kilogram, measures mass (not weight!)

$$A$$ - ampere, electric current

$$K$$ - kelvin, thermodynamic temperature

## Derived Units

$$J = W\cdot s$$ - joule, measures electric energy. Alternative units: `Wh, kWh`

$$e = J/kg$$ - joule per kilogram, measures mass specific energy. Alternative units `Wh/kg`

$$C = A\cdot s$$ - coloumb, measures electric charge. Alternative units: `mAh, Ah`

$$rad/s$$ - radian per second, measures angular velocity. Alternative units: `rpm, rps, 1/s, Hz`
