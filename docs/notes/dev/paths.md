Tips that can make code development little bit easier
and more efficient regardless of programing language, OS and your
experience.

1. Make the username simple
    - Simple to type
    - Avoid special spaces
2. Make directory and file names simple
3. Keep the source code closer to disc root

# Make your username easy to type

Make it short, use small letters (so you don't have to press ```shift```), use only Latin symbols, avoid using spaces or special symbols.

Example ```john```

You will probably have to type your username in a system terminal quite
 often. Keeping it simple will save you time and your little finger.

Sometimes you need to type a directory path in a terminal. Some
terminals require quotes if the path contains space.

```cmd
cd ./username/
cd "./user name/"
```
Removing space from path name will save you some more time.

The same advice can be applied to any directory, file name, name of
your project and other names you will have to type often.

# File names and directories

Same advice can be applied to any file and directory name.
Try to keep it short, avoid unicode (Korean or any other non-English), spaces or other special symbols.

Example of Linux system directories ```bin, usr, lib, dev, home, local, share, tmp, etc```

# Keep the source code closer to disc root

I recommend to keep all your development projects closer to disc root.
It will simplify navigation. For example:

```text
D:\src\adsp
D:\src\kds
D:\src\datafusion
```
