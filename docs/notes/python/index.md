1. Install Python
2. Install Git (Version control system)
3. Install VSCode (other IDE should be avoided)

## Install Python

First figure out which version of python is required. Ask co-authors of the program. It is not necessary the latest version.

1. [Download python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install with default settings

## Install Version Control System (Git)

1. [Download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install with default settings

## Install VSCode and Extensions (Plugins)

- [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install VSCode extensions
  - Python
  - Pylance
  - isort
  - Git Graph
  - Markdown All in One
  - markdownlint

It is highly recommended to use VSCode. Use other IDE only if you have very exact reasons to do so.

1. Open VSCode
2. Click "Extensions" button on the left vertical panel or press ```ctrl+shift+x```
3. Search for extensions
4. Install one-by-one
