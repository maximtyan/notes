## Welcome to my personal page

I am an aerospace engineer with over 15 years of experience in both academia and industry. My expertise primarily lies in Aircraft Design and Development, covering areas such as systems engineering, multidisciplinary analysis, optimization, electric and hybrid propulsion systems, flight simulation, certification, and digital twin technologies.

My team and I are dedicated to advancing research in [Advanced Air Mobility](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/aam/) (AAM). We develop innovative concepts for electric and hybrid aircraft, develop methodologies for the initial sizing of aircraft with unconventional configurations, create integrated analysis, design, and optimization frameworks, and develop flight simulation and digital twin software. Essentially, we specialize in creating tools that facilitate the development of AAM aircraft, from analyzing user requirements to the preliminary design stages.

I hold a PhD from the Department of Aerospace Information Engineering at Konkuk University in Korea. Throughout my career, I have participated in over 20 international and domestic (Korean) projects, with a total budget exceeding 25 million USD.
